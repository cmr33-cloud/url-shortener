# URL shortener

## Setup and installation
cd into the folder
install dependencies with 'pipenv install'
run server with 'python server.py'

## Using the app
Insert your desired url into the text box and click "submit"
You will be presented with the shortened url. It will work as long as the server is running.

## Troubleshooting
Make sure the url you enter is the bare bones version (don't add "http://" etc. -- the app takes care of that for you)

Make sure you're using an up-to-date version of python

If all else fails, try turning your computer off and then on again.
